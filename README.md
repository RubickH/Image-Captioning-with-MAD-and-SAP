# Image Captioning with End-to-End Attribute Detection and Subsequent Attributes Prediction

This repository includes the implementation for [Image Captioning with End-to-End Attribute Detection and Subsequent Attributes Prediction](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8976408) (IEEE TIP, 2020, vol 29).

## Requirements

- Python 2.7
- Java 1.8.0
- PyTorch 0.4.0
- cider (already been added as a submodule)
- coco-caption (already been added as a submodule)
- tensorboardX


## Training MAD+SAP

### Prepare data

See details in `data/README.md`.

You should also preprocess the dataset and get the cache for calculating cider score for [SCST](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00563):

```bash
$ python scripts/prepro_ngrams.py --input_json data/dataset_coco.json --dict_json data/cocotalk_attr.json --output_pkl data/coco-train-new --split train
```
### Start training

```bash
$ bash train.sh
```
We train our model on 2 TitanXp GPUs, you can change the batch_size and gpu_nums in xe_train.sh  to train the model on your own hardware.
See `opts.py` for the options. The pretrained models can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1-JRl_3Vf0tzyOgEwfCH6yNDIdCyobNvH).


### Evaluation
You should enter the model id and checkpoint number in eval.py before evaluation. Note that the beam size can only be altered in AttModel_MAD_SAP.py and CaptionModel.py manually. This is because opt is not compatible with multi-GPU training.
```bash
$ CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python eval.py  --num_images -1 --language_eval 1 --batch_size 100 --split test
```
